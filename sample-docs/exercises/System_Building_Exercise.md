# System Building Exercise

## What is the purpose of this exercise?

This is a levelling up exercise. It will start with simple `Next->Next->Next` installations. By the end the students should be comfortable with disc partitioning, static network configuration interrogating network traffic and setting up simple network services.

## What technologies will be used?

- Linux (CentOS, Ubuntu)
  - Basic sysadmin (disc partitioning, network configuration, user management)
- Windows Desktop
- TCP/IPV4
- VMware Workstation

### "Soft" Technologies and skills

- Note Taking
- Foundations of a personal technical toolbox

## Extension Activities

Should there be students who are **very** familiar with the content being exercised, we'll both tap into them for supporting peers and assign them extension tasks.

- Create multiple VMware networks and use host routing between segments
- Upload a custom built image to be used as an AWS AMI.

## What is visible at the end?

Notes and Cheat Sheets. 


## What resources are needed?

- Computacenter laptop with admin rights to install necessary software
  - VMware Workstation
  - Wireshark
- VMware Workstation NFT licence (liaise with Mike Hutt)
- ISO Images (Dunstan to place these behind signed URLs in S3 bucket)
