# This is a static website

This website is served as static HTML Pages.

## Pages are written in Markdown

Writing your pages is easy.

- Pages are organised in a hierarchy that is identical to the directory structure here
- Every page corresponds to a markdown file

## HTML is created by running `mkdocs`

The site you're seeing is generated by the utility `mkdocs`. Ordinarily this need not concern you: when you push your updates to gitlab a pipeline runs that regenerates the site content and uploads it to gitlab pages.

The layout you're seeing is a theme that has been applied. If the theme is changed then the appearance of the site will change, but your content will be the same.

## Static HTML is served from _gitlab.io_

The pages are uploaded to gitlab.io after the mkdocs run has created them. Again, this is all managed for you by the pipeline. Unless the pipeline has broken, all you should have to do is push/merge your changes to `master`.
